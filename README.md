# DOTFILES

The purpose of this repository is to hold various configuration and other files that I like to use with my computers that use Unix-like/Unix-based operating systems.

## Requirements
At the moment, this is intended for Ubuntu-based Linux distros, although you could manually use a lot of these files (e.g. .vimrc) with other distros.

## How to use this

```
git clone https://github.com/tdraxler/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
chmod +x install.sh && chmod +x dev_tools.sh
./install.sh
./dev_tools.sh
```
